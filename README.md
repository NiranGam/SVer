# SVer

As a part of our final project, my teammates and I were insisted to create a FinTech product using sCrypt on BSV blockchain.

**Out of personal interest, the contract was also developed in Solidity.**

SVer, restricts spendability of dispersed funds, allowances and grants, while also enabling budget management at the same time.
It ensures that allowances, grants and remittances are being used for it's intended cause. 

The proposal aims to reduce corruption and ensure that funds are spent appropriately.
